## Battery Health

Noctalia uses Quickshell and UPower to monitor your battery health. Depending on your hardware, battery health information may appear in the battery panel.

## Battery Charge Threshold

Managing your battery's charge threshold can significantly extend its lifespan by preventing it from remaining at 100% for long periods of time.

### Battery Threshold Plugin

Noctalia offers a [battery-threshold](https://github.com/noctalia-dev/noctalia-plugins/tree/main/battery-threshold) plugin. This allows you to set and manage your battery charge thresholds directly from the Noctalia shell on systems that support it.

### System-wide Management

For users who prefer a more comprehensive, system-wide solution, we recommend using [TLP](https://linrunner.de/tlp/). TLP is a feature-rich command-line utility for Linux which saves laptop battery power without the need to delve into every technical detail.

> [!TIP]
> When using TLP, you should generally uninstall or disable `power-profiles-daemon` to ensure there are no conflicts between the two power management services.
