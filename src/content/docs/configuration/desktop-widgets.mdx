Desktop widgets are floating, draggable components that sit on top of your wallpaper. Noctalia ships four built-in widgets — Clock, Media Player, Weather, and System Stats — and plugins can add their own.

## Enabling Desktop Widgets

Desktop widgets are disabled by default. To turn them on:

1. Open **Settings** → **Desktop Widgets**
2. Toggle **Enable Desktop Widgets**

## Adding and Managing Widgets

All widget management is done from **Settings → Desktop Widgets**:

- **Add a widget** — click **Add Widget** and pick from the list
- **Remove a widget** — click the remove button on a widget entry
- **Configure a widget** — click the gear icon to open its settings dialog

Widgets are stored per-monitor, so each screen can have its own set.

## Positioning and Scaling

Enable **Edit Mode** to freely position and resize widgets:

- **Drag** to move a widget anywhere on the desktop
- **Right-click drag** to scale a widget up or down
- **Grid Snap** — enable in settings to snap widgets to a grid while dragging

Exit edit mode when you're done. Positions and scales are saved automatically.

## Performance Considerations

Some widgets continuously poll hardware counters or perform expensive rendering. Noctalia marks these as **CPU-intensive** and will warn you when adding them. The **System Stats** widget falls into this category.

If you notice increased CPU usage or battery drain, consider removing CPU-intensive widgets or limiting how many are active at once.

## Plugin Widgets

Plugins can register their own desktop widgets. Once a plugin with a desktop widget is installed and enabled, it appears in the **Add Widget** picker alongside the built-in widgets.

See the [Desktop Widget plugin guide](/development/plugins/desktop-widget/) for how to build one.
