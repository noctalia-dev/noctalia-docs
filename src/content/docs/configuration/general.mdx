**Note on language:**

If the setting is left blank (`""`), Noctalia will automatically detect your system's language and apply the corresponding translation, if one is available.

To manually configure the language, set the value to one of the supported languages:

- English:    `"en"`
- German:     `"de"`
- Spanish:    `"es"`
- French:     `"fr"`
- Portuguese: `"pt"`
- Chinese (Simplified):    `"zh-CN"`

New languages can be found and added in [Translations](https://github.com/noctalia-dev/noctalia-shell/tree/main/Assets/Translations) directory of the Noctalia shell Github repository.
