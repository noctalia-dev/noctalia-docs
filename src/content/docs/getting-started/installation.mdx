Noctalia is packaged for [Arch Linux](#arch) and [NixOS](/getting-started/nixos), but can also be [installed manually](#manual-install) in other distributions.

## Arch Linux {#arch}

### Using AUR (Recommended)

The simplest way to install Noctalia on Arch Linux is through the Arch User Repository (AUR). This method installs the shell system-wide and handles dependencies automatically.

Please replace with your AUR helper of choice.

```bash
paru -S noctalia-shell
```

### Development Version

For the latest features and fixes, you can install the development version directly from the Git repository:

```bash
paru -S noctalia-shell-git
```

:::caution
The development version may be less stable than the official release. Use this version if you want to test the latest features or contribute to development.

## Manual Installation {#manual-install}

If you prefer to install Noctalia locally or want more control over the installation process, you can install it manually to your user configuration directory. This method works on any Linux distribution.

**Step 1**: Install required dependencies

For Arch Linux:

```bash
# Core dependencies (required)
paru -S quickshell ttf-roboto inter-font gpu-screen-recorder brightnessctl

# Desktop monitor brightness (may cause instability with some monitors)
paru -S ddcutil

# Optional dependencies
paru -S cliphist matugen-git cava wlsunset xdg-desktop-portal python3 evolution-data-server

# Polkit agent (can be any other agent)
paru -S polkit-kde-agent
```

For other distributions, install the equivalent packages using your package manager.

**Step 2**: Download and install Noctalia

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/quickshell/noctalia-shell && \
curl -sL https://github.com/noctalia-dev/noctalia-shell/releases/latest/download/noctalia-latest.tar.gz | \
tar -xz --strip-components=1 -C ~/.config/quickshell/noctalia-shell
```

### Dependencies Explained

**Required:**

- `quickshell` - Core shell framework
- `ttf-roboto` - Default UI font
- `inter-font` - Headers font (clock on LockScreen, etc.)
- `gpu-screen-recorder` - Screen recording functionality
- `brightnessctl` - Internal/laptop monitor brightness control

**Hardware-specific:**

- `ddcutil` - Desktop monitor brightness control (⚠️ may introduce system instability with certain monitors)

**Optional but recommended:**

- `cliphist` - Clipboard history support
- `matugen-git` - Material You color scheme generation
- `cava` - Audio visualizer component
- `wlsunset` - Night light functionality
- `xdg-desktop-portal` - Enables "Portal" option in screen recorder
- `python3`, `evolution-data-server` - Calendar events
- `polkit-kde-agent` - Only needed to authenticate Battery Manager installation for laptop charge limits; skip if installing via Bin/battery-manager/install-battery-manager.sh with sudo.

:::tip
Manual installation keeps Noctalia contained within your user directory, making it easy to remove or update without affecting system packages.

## Compositor Settings

For the best experience with Noctalia, you'll need to configure your compositor with some specific settings.

### Niri

Add these settings to your Niri configuration file (usually `~/.config/niri/config.kdl`):

```ini
window-rule {
    geometry-corner-radius 20
    clip-to-geometry true
}

layer-rule {
    match namespace="^quickshell-overview$"
    place-within-backdrop true
}

debug {
    honor-xdg-activation-with-invalid-serial
}
```

These settings ensure:

- Proper window activation handling
- Rounded corners for a modern look
- Correct backdrop placement for the overview panel
- Allows Notification actions (`honor-xdg-activation-with-invalid-serial`)
- Makes the file picker float (`match app-id="qs"`)

:::note
The configuration files are saved in `~/.config/noctalia/` and the cache files are saved in `~/.cache/noctalia/`.
