:::tip[Method]
Follow either Autostart by compositor or by Systemd, do not do both.
:::
### Autostart by your Wayland compositor
This is the recommended method for launching noctalia-shell, as it integrates with your window manager.

For the *Niri* compositor, add the following line to the end of your configuration file, typically located at `~/.config/niri/config.kdl`
```ini
spawn-at-startup "qs" "-c" "noctalia-shell" "--no-duplicate"
```

For the *Hyprland* compositor, append this line to your configuration file, typically located at `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`
```ini
exec-once = qs -c noctalia-shell --no-duplicate
```

:::tip[Important]
- Be aware that the command might need to be adjusted based on how you installed `noctalia-shell`.
- **Manual installation**: If you installed Noctalia into `~/.config/quickshell/`, you can use `qs` to start it. For keybindings, you must use `qs ipc ...` instead.
:::


### Running as a Systemd Service (Advanced)
For more robust process management, you can configure Noctalia to run as a systemd user service. This approach provides automatic restarts on failure and centralizes logging with `journalctl`.

:::tip[AUR Installation]
If you installed `noctalia-shell` or `noctalia-shell-git` from the AUR, the service file is already included. You can skip to step 2.
:::

#### 1. Create the service file
First, create a new service definition file at `~/.config/systemd/user/noctalia.service` with the following content:

```toml
[Unit]
Description=Noctalia Shell Service
PartOf=graphical-session.target
Requisite=graphical-session.target
After=graphical-session.target

[Service]
ExecStart=qs -c noctalia-shell --no-duplicate
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=1

[Install]
WantedBy=graphical-session.target
```

#### 2. Enable and Start the Service

Next, enable the service to have it start automatically with your graphical session.

<details>
<summary><strong>Niri</strong></summary>

If you use a compositor like Niri, it's best to tie Noctalia directly to it. This ensures they start and stop together and passes critical environment variables to the service.

```bash
# Example for Niri users
systemctl --user add-wants niri.service noctalia.service
```

```bash
# Start the service
systemctl --user start noctalia.service
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Other Compositors (no UWSM)</strong></summary>
:::note
Adjust for your compositor's syntax.

:::

If you use a compositor which doesn't provide services or targets to bind to (in this example Hyprland), then:

To launch the provided AUR service file Noctalia ships (and any others which bind to `graphical-session.target`) without having to resort to using UWSM:

##### 1. Create a target file
At `~/.config/systemd/user/`, I called mine `hyprland-session.target`, with contents of:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Hyprland Session Target
Requires=graphical-session.target
After=graphical-session.target
```
(`Description` contents can be whatever you like.)

##### 2. Adjust your compositor configuration file
In the section that starts things, after any and all environment variables (where everything should be anyway), add the following <u>before anything else</u> (Hyprland syntax in this case again, adjust as needed):
```ini
exec-once = dbus-update-activation-environment --systemd --all
exec-once = systemctl --user start hyprland-session.target
```

##### 3. Bind service to compositor target
<u>Do not **enable** it, this will cause it to run on **any** DE/WM!</u> (If you already did so, just disable it.) This example is for Hyprland:
```sh
systemctl --user add-wants hyprland-session.target noctalia.service
```
Optionally bind xdg-desktop-autostart to it as well:
```sh
systemctl --user add-wants hyprland-session.target xdg-desktop-autostart.target
```

##### 4. Lastly
Reboot, re-log in, or simply run `systemctl --user start hyprland-session.target` (or however you named it for your compositor) and everything set to start with your compositor of choice (Hyprland in this case), including Noctalia, will start and stop when you log out or stop the target for whatever reason.

Finally, pick one of the following two categories:

<details>
<summary><strong>Raw systemd-run (unformatted scope names)</strong></summary>
Go into `Settings -> Launcher -> Execute` and tick on `Enable custom launch prefix` with a value of:

```sh
systemd-run --user --scope --collect
```
You may want to additionally add everything that executes into a different slice, or a sub-slice or an existing slice or a sub-slice of an existing slice, by appending for example `--slice=desktop.slice` at the end to make up a new user slice called "desktop" or `--slice=app-desktop.slice` to add it to an existing user slice (app) under a made up slice "desktop".

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Neatly formatted systemd-run script</strong></summary>
:::note
Untested for snaps.

:::

First, copy the following script:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Usage:
#
# Modify the launcher and slice variables, optionally try your hand at filtering stuff
# in appid before the grep, don't touch anything else
# once done, save as exec-app (or whatever else you like, just make sure that the name isn't already some
# other binary name that exists), place into ~/.local/bin/ and make executable
# call by running "exec-app somebinary" (or whatever you named it)
# and/or use it with noctalia's launcher/compositor binds as prefix, I suggest both everywhere
#
# NOTE:
# If you had to create ~/.local/bin/ it will not be known to noctalia as part of $PATH if it's already running
# you must restart it, or do the usual logout/reboot, as you prefer if restarting it doesn't work

# Is it a flatpak? if so, there's no point in trying to wrap it into this, and we skip to the end
flatpak=$(printf "$@" | grep flatpak)

# Is it an appimage? If so, you may wish to uncomment what is right below flatpak,
# as some appimages run as services, which are better than scopes, but you lose the formatting
# and many appimages likely don't, I was using a cherrypicked appimage that did for testing;
appimage=$(printf "$@" | grep appimage)
if [ -n "$flatpak" ]; then
    exec "$@"
# elif [ -n "$appimage" ]; then
#     exec "$@"
else
    # Modify the launcher prefix:
    launcher="noctalia"

    # Modify the slice, or sub-slice you want to launch it under:
    # examples:
    # app.slice - default slice, exists, standard convention
    # desktop.slice - made-up slice that lives right under the user slice, doesn't exist and is made on call
    # app-desktop.slice - creates the desktop slice under the app slice which is under the user slice
    slice="app.slice"

    # Try to guess a sensible ApplicationID, expected end format is:
    #
    # firstword-word-word-...-finalword - regular binaries
    # firstword - appimages
    #
    appid=$(printf '%s\n' "$@"                                              \
        | sed 's/^env\s*//'                                                 \
        | sed '/^[A-Z_][A-Z0-9_]*=/d'                                       \
        | sed 's|^\./||'                                                    \
        | sed 's|[^a-zA-Z0-9].*\.appimage$||'                               \
        | sed '/^--[^ ]/d'                                                  \
        | sed -e "/^start$/d"                                               \
              -e "/^\/unix$/d"                                              \
              -e "/^%f$/d"                                                  \
              -e 's|^'"$HOME"'/[^[:space:]]*\/\(.*\)\.[eE][xX][eE]$|\1|'    \
        | grep -v '^$'                                                      \
        | sed '$!s/\([^-\]\)$/\1-/'                                         \
        | tr -cd '[:alnum:]-'                                               \
        | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')

    # Generate random instance id (collision-resistant)
    random=$(openssl rand -hex 6)

    unit="app-${launcher}-${appid}-${random}"

    exec systemd-run --user \
        --slice="$slice"    \
        --unit="$unit"      \
        --scope             \
        --collect           \
        -- "$@"
fi
```
Read through the comments and save it under `~/.local/bin/` (if the folder doesn't exist, first make hidden folders are on, if it still doesn't exist in `~/.local/` make it) under whichever name you like without any extension, 
just be sure a binary under the same name doesn't already exist. I will assume `exec-app` for the purposes of this guide. If you had to make the folder, be sure it is listed in `echo $PATH` under a new shell, 
if not, add it to $PATH and follow the standard reset procedure in the script's comments.

Then, go into `Settings -> Launcher -> Execute` and tick on `Enable custom launch prefix` with a value of:
```sh
exec-app
```
Lastly, here is an example usage in hyprland of it:
```sh
# Keyword section
# ...
$prefix = exec-app
# ...
# Keybinds section
bind = $mainMod, E, exec, $prefix dolphin
```

### Manual Launch for Debugging
The most direct way to run Noctalia for testing or debugging is to invoke it through Quickshell. Open a terminal and execute:
```bash
qs -c noctalia-shell --no-duplicate
```

:::tip[Preventing Multiple Instances]
The `--no-duplicate` flag prevents multiple instances of Noctalia from running simultaneously. If an instance is already running, the command will exit gracefully instead of starting a duplicate.
