:::tip[Method]
Use compositor autostart as the primary method.
:::
### Autostart by your Wayland compositor
This is the recommended method for launching noctalia-shell, as it integrates with your window manager.

For the *Niri* compositor, add the following line to the end of your configuration file, typically located at `~/.config/niri/config.kdl`
```ini
spawn-at-startup "qs" "-c" "noctalia-shell"
```

For the *Hyprland* compositor, append this line to your configuration file, typically located at `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`
```ini
exec-once = qs -c noctalia-shell
```

:::tip[Important]
- Be aware that the command might need to be adjusted based on how you installed `noctalia-shell`.
- **Manual installation**: If you installed Noctalia into `~/.config/quickshell/`, you can use `qs` to start it. For keybindings, you must use `qs ipc ...` instead.

:::note[Legacy systemd setup]
Systemd startup instructions were moved to [Systemd Startup (Deprecated)](/deprecated/systemd-startup/).
:::

### Manual Launch for Debugging
The most direct way to run Noctalia for testing or debugging is to invoke it through Quickshell. Open a terminal and execute:
```bash
qs -c noctalia-shell
```
